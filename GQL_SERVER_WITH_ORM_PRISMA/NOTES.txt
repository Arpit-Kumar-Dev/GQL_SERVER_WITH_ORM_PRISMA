make a docker.compose file make the nesseary changes build the container and keep it runing 

prisma setup command 
npm init -y
npm install prisma typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev

then 
npx tsc --init


now after making conection string of prisma for postgress

set the schema in schema.prisma file 

now open terminal go in the container which is runing 
by using docker comands like
docker ps 
docker exce -it ( container id)  bash ---> to run it in background
 
su postgres
psql
\l  (to list databases)
\c threads (databases name)  to get conected to threads data base
\d (check relations)
\d relation_name (to see attributes of user)
\x for better view
now we have to set schema of prisma which we have defined . into our postgres data base which is runing on 
container so we have to migrate

npx prisma migrate dev --name (enter your name ex-migrate)
**(you have to run this command it you make change in prisma file)
after this your prisma databases will be copyed to postgres container.
